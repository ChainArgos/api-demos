{% @github-files/github-code-block url="https://github.com/ChainArgos/api-demos/blob/main/looker_api_basic/conn_test.py" %}

To run copy `sanitizied.ini` to `looker.ini` and then fill in `client_id` and `client_secret`.

This example connects to Looker and prints out the title and `id` of every dashboard your account can access.
