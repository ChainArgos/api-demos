# Running a Look/Query with multiple fields via API

Here we are going to run a look with modified filter values and retrieve the results.
This demo uses [this Look](https://dashargos.chainargos.com/looks/729).

It is similar to the simple single-filter example we already covered.
But adds both a) filter values as lists and b) multiple filters at once.
