# Looker API queries

It is also possible to directly access Looks via API and change the query parameters programmatically.
This is useful both for more complex setups you cannot build in Google Sheets and when you also want
to build an interactive version of the same interface.

The API requires a credentials.
Instructions to set up credentials are [here](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/api-auth).
You can also contact ChainArgos for credential support.

Looker's own API documentation is [here](https://developers.looker.com/api/explorer/4.0/).
The examples are limited.
You definitely want to understand both [a minimal connection](looker_api_basic/README.md)
and [a simple but realistic use case](look_query/README.md)
before bothering with those docs.
